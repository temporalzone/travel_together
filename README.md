# travel-together
Nowadays, many travelling or trekking groups have emerged to help travel enthusiasts explore various places at once. These groups consist of all kinds of travellers, including groups of friends, family, strangers and more. With the rise of such groups, we have decided to develop a project that will help travel enthusiasts get in touch with the different travelling groups.

Our Python-based project, Travel Together – A Travel Group Social System Using Python is designed and developed with travel enthusiasts in mind. It can help individuals connect with other groups who are travelling to the places they want to travel. They can search for groups they want and chat with the members of the group they join for more information.

In this Python-based project, there is only one module: User. The user would need to register first to log into the system. After registering, the user can log in using their credentials. In this system, the user can search for the group by directly typing their name or using choose by type filter. They can view the list of groups and the group details. If the group is private, the user can request to join. If the group is public, the user can view all the chat details. The user can also view the members, and their chat details and can post a new chat as well.

The user can also create a group if they want. They can add the group details and choose the option of whether they want to keep the group private or public. The user can view the members who want to join the group and accordingly update the status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Blocked). The system is designed in a way in which the owner of the private group can approve or reject a user’s request to join. The owner also has the access to block a user if they want.

In this project, the front end involves Html, CSS and JavaScript and the back end involves Python. The database used is MySQL Database and Django is used for the framework.
